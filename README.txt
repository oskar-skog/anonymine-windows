Installation instructions for Windows
=====================================
    
    The game doesn't work on native Windows, so it will install Cygwin
    automatically.
    
    Notes
    =====
    
        - It is known that certain anti-virus programs can interfere with
          Cygwin. https://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.using.bloda
        
        - Cygwin will require approx 200 MB of disk space.
        
        - There seems to be some issue with resizing, possibly the terminals
          fault.
     
    1.  Extract the directory "anonymine-windows" from the zip file.
    
    2.  Enter that extracted folder and start Windows-admin[.bat] or
        Windows-user[.bat]. (Windows-user.bat will install Cygwin in your home
        directory and doesn't require administrator privileges.)
    
    3.  After a while, the Cygwin installer will launch and ask you to select
        a mirror to download Cygwin from.  After choosing the mirror you will
        only have to click "next" a few times.
        (This will only happen the first time you install the game.)
    
    4.  Answer the questions that appear in the terminal window.
