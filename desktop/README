Freedesktop.org
===============

A .desktop launcher will be created to start Anonymine in a terminal.

desktop.sh will generate a .desktop file to be installed in
`$(prefix)/share/applications/`.

[Desktop entry specification](
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
)

The PNGs (including the 256x256) will be installed in
`$(prefix)/share/icons/hicolor/$(size)/apps/$(NAME).png`.
Ex:
```
/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/anonymine.png
/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/anonymine.png
/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/64x64/apps/anonymine.png
/usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/anonymine.png
```

["Icon theme specification"](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html)



Mac OS X
========

A bundle (app) will be created that simulates a `.desktop` file.

`Info.plist.py` will generate the `Info.plist` for the bundle.

[Bundle doc.](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/BundleTypes/BundleTypes.html)
[`Info.plist` doc.](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html)
[`Info.plist` Example](http://developerfriendly.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mozilla/xulrunner/WebRunner_app/Contents/Info.plist)

`icon.icns.py` will put all the PNGs in an .icns icon.
The 256x256 PNG inside the .icns is supported since Mac OS X 10.5,
while the PNGs of more reasonable sizes are only supported since 10.7.

[ICNS format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format)

The Makefile will create the Bundle structure on installation.



Cygwin
======

The game does not run on native Windows.  The windoze installer will
automatically fetch and install Cygwin.

`anonymine.ico.xcf` is a GIMP image where all the PNGs have been imported
as layers.  This file shall be exported to `anonymine.ico` if the icons get
changed.



Editing the icons
=================

-   `*.xcf` are the GIMP images of all the icons.
-   The large (256x256) is required for supporting older versions of Mac OS X.
-   PNG is the preferred format for freedesktop.org.
-   The set of icons is rather static.
-   `anonymine.*` can be changed from the Makefile.

1.  Edit all of `anonymine-16x16.xcf`, `anonymine-32x32.xcf`,
    `anonymine-64x64.xcf` and `anonymine-256x256.xcf` and export them
    as PNGs.

2.  Recreate 'anonymine.ico.xcf' by importing all the PNGs as layers,
    and export as *.ico.

NOTE: If you change the set of icons, you must also modify
'../Makefile.static' and 'icon.icns.py' to support the new list of sizes.

NOTE: The 'anonymine'-part of all filenames is actually $(NAME) in the
Makefile.
